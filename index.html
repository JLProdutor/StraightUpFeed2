<!-- Some random information for the user :)

JSX = JavaScript + XML.

Default Exports vs Named Exports:
Default = The name can be changed on the import side;
Named = The name cannot be changed on the import side.

Components:
Can be reused on other parts of the page.

Props:
An actual object with properties.
props: { author: "", content: ""}

Iteration:
Repeat (Reuse) something on the page / Repeating Structure.

State:
Variables that I want the component to monitor.

Imperative Programming:
What should be done (step-by-step).

Declarative Programming:
What are the conditions to obtain the final result.

Key on React:
Why the key needs to be unique? 
Because React uses the key to identify the component.
Components are rendered on 3 different places:
1 - When the state change;
2 - When the props change;
3 - When the 'father' component is rendered.
Needs to be unique to identify what component is being rendered and what alredy has rendered.
Why I can't use the index from array? 
Because if index change, the array is updated and values are changed.

Immutability:
The value of a variable cannot be changed.
A new variable is created with the new value.

React Closures:
Variables that are not defined inside the function, but are used inside the function.
